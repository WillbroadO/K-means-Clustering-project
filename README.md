Customer segmentation with K-means clustering 

Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways. You can provide different value propositions to different customer groups. Customer segments are usually determined on similarities, such as personal characteristics, preferences or behaviours that should correlate with the same behaviours that drive customer profitability.
